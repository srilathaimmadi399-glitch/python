'''
problem with list:
list = [1,2,3,4,5]
entire list is stored in memory
nums = [i for i in range(100000)]
python consumes:
high memory
slower

Generator:
produces values one at a time only when it is needed saves memory




'''
#Example:
def numbers():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
x = numbers()
print(x)  

#access the numbers
print(next(x))
print(next(x))

'''
1.first next()
yield 1 ->1
function paused

2.second next()
resume from previous position
yield 2 --> 2
function pause

3.third next()
resume from previous position
yield 3 --> 3
pause again 

Generators:
remembers the variables
remember line position
continue from the same place

# diff between return and yield
return                      yield
ends the function           pauses the function
returns single value by 1   will return multiple values
no state memory             remembers the state

#lazy evaluation

values are generated when needed
generators are lazy
